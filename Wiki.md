The afforable housing crisis is the cost of housing becoming increasinly unsuitable for renters and buyers. This is seen by renters spending more than 30% of their income on housing cost defined as *cost-burden*. With the increase of housing prices rising quicker than wage growth in the U.S has causes many renters to be in **cost-burdened situations** (Addressing America’s Affordable Housing Crisis, 2023).

To accurately address the housing affordability with policy solutions, communities need to identify the specific cause of the housing affordability issues. As the cause can differ by jurisdiction. 

## Rising construction costs:
High demand for construction labor and materials directly increase the cost to developing new housing.

## Short-term rentals:

Airbnbs have influenced renting out unoccupied homes and made it difficult for homeowners to purchase, especially in areas that have high recreatiqonal appeal. Short-term rentals have strinked the amount of availabled housing and increased the cost of rent in the community (MRSC - Background About Affordable Housing, n.d.).

Over the pas few years, due to the effects of Covid-19 pandemic there has been record high inflation, significant job losses, and rising rent prices have shaped the affordable housing landscape. In years 2019-2021 the shortage of homes affordablity and availablity to renters with extremely low incomes worsened by more than 500,000 units. The shortage increased from 6.8 million to 7.3 million, and continuing a long-term trend of diminishing supply (Beck, 2023).  



## The Gap

The Gap in terms of affordable housing is used to describe the housing market. It states that there are more luxurious homes available for purchase than people who can afford them. The gap disregards the living wage of the residents in the area and tells us that there is a shortage of affordable housing.
